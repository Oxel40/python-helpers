# python-helpers
Some helper functions and classes I've developed and used in some of my personal projects

## Installation
This module can be installed with the use of `pip`, just type something like:
```bash
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/Oxel40/python-helpers
```
into your terminal of choice.
> NOTE: you might need to change out `python` in the above command to install the module 
> to your desired python version

## Documentation
Don't expect much in the way of documentation, for now. I might document some of the classes and functions
sometime in the future when (and if) i feel like it.
But feel free to view the source code, which is quite short. 

## Examples
Some examples has been included in the `examples` folder to show how one could use some of the modules.
